# frontendmentor.io website mimic
This repo is for practicing front-end development. Using frontendmentor.io as a "starting template".
I've been following Udemy frontend courses after completing the Le Wagon bootcamp, and building little projects on the side for fun. This is my first of hopefully many single page websites (just desining a landing page for instance, not an entire SPA website).
This mimic project is purely HTML and CSS; in the future I'll add in some vanilla JavaScript, then make projects with React, maybe throw bootstrap in a few.
These small projects are to keep my frontend skills fresh as I continue to learn and develop more complex projects every day.

Thanks for taking the time to read, stay awesome :)
